Here is a list of concepts that are required and that actually have been asked into the exam without any exaggeration :)

\
**--DATA SCIENCE --**



**Descriptive statistics:** correlation, summary statistics, p-value

**Probability Distributions:** Binomial, Poisson, Bernoulli, Gaussian, Direchlet, Gamma etc.)

**Scaling and Normalization:** Min-Max Scaling, Standardization (Z-score normalization), Logarithmic scaling

**Dimensionality reduction:** PCA, LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)

**Feature Selection:** Univariate feature selection (e.g., chi-squared, ANOVA), Recursive feature elimination, Feature importance from tree-based models)

**Time Series Feature Engineering:** Lag features (time-shifted values), Rolling statistics (e.g., moving averages), Seasonal decomposition

**Text Feature Engineering:** Bag of Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), Word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, Obj2Vec, GloVe)

**Feature Cross-Validation:** k-fold, stratified k-fold

**Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, Stop-word removal, Stemming, Lemmatization

**Imputation:** MICE (Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations)

**Encoding Categorical Data:** One-Hot Encoding, Label Encoding, Target Encoding

**Visualization:** graphs (scatter plots, time series, histograms, box

plot, bar plot)



**--MACHINE LEARNING--**



**Modelling techniques:** classification, regression, forecasting, clustering, recommendation

**Models (Supervised):** XGBoost, Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Ensemble Learning, Neural Networks (RNN,CNN,LSTM), Multi-Layered Perceptron, BERT

**Models (Unsupervised):** Clustering techniques (K-Means)

**Transfer Learning**

**Model Evaluation:** RMSE, MAE, MAPE, Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC, detecting and handling bias & variance, A/B testing

**Hyperparameter optimization:** Regularization (L1,L2), Drop out, Early stopping, Understanding neural network architecture (number of layers and nodes), learning rate, activation functions (Sigmoid, Softmax, ReLU, TanH etc.) &#x20;

**Deployment and operationalization of ML solutions:** Exposing endpoints and interacting with them, Retraining pipelines, Debugging and troubleshooting ML models, Detecting and mitigating drops in model performance. Monitoring model performance\


**--AWS Services--**



**Create data repositories for ML:**

ï‚· Identify data sources (for example, content and location, primary sources such as user data).

ï‚· Determine storage mediums (for example, databases, Amazon S3, Amazon Elastic File System \[Amazon EFS], Amazon Elastic Block Store \[Amazon EBS])&#x20;



**Identify and implement a data ingestion and transformation solution:**

ï‚· Identify data job styles and job types (for example, batch load, streaming)

ï‚· Transform data in transit (ETL, AWS Glue, Amazon EMR, AWS Batch).&#x20;

ï‚· Handle ML-specific data by using MapReduce (for example, Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, Apache Hive).

ï‚· Orchestrate data ingestion and transformation pipelines (batch-based ML workloads and streaming-based ML workloads) with the help of:

&#x20;   o Amazon Kinesis

&#x20;   o Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose

&#x20;   o Amazon EMR

&#x20;   o AWS Glue

&#x20;   o Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink

&#x20;   o Data Wrangler

ï‚· Schedule jobs &#x20;
